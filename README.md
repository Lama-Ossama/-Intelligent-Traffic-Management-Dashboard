# Intelligent Traffic Management Dashboard 

##  Project Overview
Cities face challenges in monitoring traffic congestion and reacting quickly to peak times and incidents.
This project provides a real-time traffic monitoring system that collects simulated traffic sensor data and displays insights through a dashboard.

The solution focuses on DevOps practices including automation, containerization, CI/CD, monitoring, and scalable deployment.



##  Project Objectives
- Collect traffic data from simulated IoT sensors or CSV logs
- Display real-time traffic congestion metrics
- Detect peak times and trigger alerts
- Deploy services using Docker and Kubernetes
- Automate CI/CD using Jenkins
- Monitor system performance with Prometheus and Grafana
- Use Nginx as a reverse proxy
- Provision AWS infrastructure using Terraform
- Configure servers using Ansible


## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
